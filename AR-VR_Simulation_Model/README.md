<h1 align ="center">AR/VR Simulation Model</h1><hr>
 
>### This VR Model will be responsible for training Police Officials for *real life like scenarios* in various circumstances. we have also implemented an AI training app which will help in detecting the performance of the police officials while training in VR. It also detects the features of the officer during training such as *heart rate, emotion and stress* under several situations in VR and generates a report inside the customized virtual fitness trainer app.
>
>### The Simulation has been implemented to train Police Officials for dealing in several circumstances providing them real life simulation including several factors such as *weather, terrain mobs etc* 
>
>### We will also help them with a Virtual Fitness Trainer which is integrated with our Fitness Flutter App and our Chat Bot.
